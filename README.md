#### Brief Description of your Solution - 

The task assigned to our project team (Team 84) is to create a social media network specifically for foodies to share their eating experiences. To ensure seamless interaction with the mobile app being developed by a different company, our objective is to design a web-application and REST API for the platform. User profiles, post creation and editing, reacting to and commenting on posts, sharing posts, and OAuth-based authentication are some of the platform's key features. 
 
The REST API will be engineered using Spring Boot, and the client application will be developed using React. Authentication and authorization will be handled by Spring Security and Spring OAuth2, and social login options will also be available. 
 
Our team has identified both functional and non-functional needs for the REST API and web application, and these will be considered when building the platform. 
 
Our team will create a secure, robust, and maintainable platform in accordance with the architecture diagrams we designed to emphasize creativity and innovation. To ensure effective team cooperation, version control will be implemented using GitHub Workflow.
